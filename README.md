# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Description:
This project provides an analysis of global COVID-19 trends, focusing on cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination rates across several countries. The project uses real-world data from sources like "Our World in Data" and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends and generate insights.

## Objectives:
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
- Perform time-series analysis on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Visualize trends using graphs and choropleth maps.
- Present insights in a clear and organized manner.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (for maps and pie charts)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps and Process:
1. *Data Collection*: The project collects data from "Our World in Data" and uses it to track COVID-19 trends across different countries.
2. *Data Cleaning*: The data is cleaned, including filtering relevant countries and handling missing values.
3. *Data Analysis*: The analysis focuses on new cases, deaths, vaccination rates, and visualizing time-series trends.
4. *Visualizations*:  
   - Line charts for cases and deaths over time.  
   - Choropleth maps showing vaccination progress.

## Results & Insights:
- Insights from the data include comparisons between Egypt, Kenya, and India regarding their vaccination rates and COVID-19 case trends over time.

## How to Run the Project:
1. Install Python and the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
